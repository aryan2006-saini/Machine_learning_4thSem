# 🌟 Machine Learning Practice Repository

This repository contains my Machine Learning practical codes, experiments, and projects.  
It includes implementations of ML algorithms from scratch, dataset analysis, preprocessing, and visualizations — documenting my journey as I learn and grow in ML.

## 🚀 Goals of This Repository
- Implement ML algorithms **from scratch**
- Practice regression, classification, and clustering
- Perform **EDA and data preprocessing**
- Build clean and reusable ML code
- Strengthen core ML fundamentals as a CS student
